# Random dashboard example

In this example you can see a node webserver that uses the Tadaboard node library to build the response

## Usage

First install dependencies

```bash
$ npm install
```

then run the webserver a point a dashboard to your address (you may use something like localtunnel or ngrok) if you don't have a public address:

```bash
$ node index.js
```
